Hi Coders!

Eleanor Here! I am currently learning Python on my own as a first time coder! I am in Los Angeles and I am unemployed due to the pandemic! What better way to spend my free hours than toiling at home trying to learn a foreign language. As my Coding brother once told me "When you meet a coder, you're meeting someone who's core daily experience is grinding failure and unending frustration" Sounds Fun!
